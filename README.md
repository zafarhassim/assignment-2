This program creates a playlist of songs in ascending order and plays them in that order. The history of when they are played is recorded as well. The files containing these songs were read in using a stack. They were “popped” one by one into arrays and then merged into a single arraylist. They were then read into and resorted by two queue like structures to create the playlist. To record the history of when each song in the playlist that was requested; a stack was implemented. Where the playlist songs were popped off into it.
